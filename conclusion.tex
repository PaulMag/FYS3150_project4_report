This project has discussed different numerical integration schemes
and their area of use. Furthermore the algorithms were implemented
to solve a one dimensional diffusion equation problem.

On account of error and stability analysis, the Crank Nicolson
scheme is observed to produce the least numerical error whilst
spanning a greater area of stability compared to its explicit
counterpart and the Backward Euler scheme.
