This project has discussed different numerical integration schemes
and their area of use. Furthermore the algorithms were implemented
to solve a one dimensional diffusion equation problem.

On account of error and stability analysis, the Crank Nicolson
scheme is observed to produce the least numerical error while
covering a larger span of timesteps and spanning a greater area of
stability compared to its explicit counterpart and the Backward
Euler scheme. If one can afford to have a very small timestep the
Forward Euler scheme is most accurate, yet strongly dependent on
the size of the time step.
