This project has discussed different numerical integration schemes
and their area of use. Furthermore the algorithms were implemented
to solve a one dimensional diffusion equation problem.

On account of error and stability analysis, the Crank Nicolson
scheme is observed to produce the least numerical error for the greates span of 
timesteps whilst spanning a greater area of stability compared to its explicit
counterpart and the Backward Euler scheme. If one can afford to have a 
very small timestep the Forward Euler scheme is most accurate, but only then.
