Communication in the brain relies heavily on the diffusion of neurotransmitters
across the synaptic cleft, which separates the cell membranes of two cells.
A solution to the diffusion equation can be used to describe this process, so 
we apply three numerical methods for solving the one-dimensional case. The closed
form solution is used to analyze the numerical accuracy of the explicit
forward Euler, and the implicit backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson scheme. It
shows that the explicit forward Euler algorithm yields the most accurate
results for small temporal step lengths, but at the loss of stability.
The backward case is stable, but with the
poorest accuracy. The Crank-Nicolson scheme applies both
the explicit forward Euler and the implicit backward Euler, resulting in a
stable method, with an accuracy that surpasses the forward Euler scheme for
higher temporal step lengths. 
The implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme seems
then to be preferred in applications where a very small spatial step length is required,
as to avoid compensating with an even smaller temporal step length --- which will
induce a penalty in computation time.

%The dominant means of communication between neurons in the brain depend on
%diffusion of signal molecules called \emph{neurotransmitters} across the
%synaptic cleft that separates the cell membranes of two cells. The
%neurotransmitters are released by vesicles in the axon terminal, upon which
%receptors on the postsynaptic side receive the signal. Further insight in this
%process can be helpful within the field of medicine for treating patients that
%suffer from various illnesses caused by impaired communication in the brain.
%
%We will try to simulate the process of diffusion of neurotransmitters across the
%synaptic cleft by solving the diffusion equation. We do the simulation by
%solving the one-dimensional case using three numerical methods, then 
%
%We will however, in our work, mostly consider the differences in numerical
%accuracy between various numerical methods that solve the one-dimensional case.
