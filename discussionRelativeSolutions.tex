Figure \refig{zoomed_schemes} shows that the Forward Euler solution
tends to have higher values than the closed form solution while the
CrankNicolson and Backward Euler schemes tend to have lower values
and lie closer to the closed form.

The idea behind the Forward Euler scheme is to follow the tangent
(the derivative) of the function a predetermined step size, in our
case $\Delta t$. If the derivative tends to have positive values,
this might cause the scheme to approximate values above the closed
form.

Considering the implicit Backward Euler scheme --- this method
might have similar properties causing it to tend to lower values.
