The purpose of this exercise is to simulate the diffusion of signal
molecules between neurons, both analytically and numerically. These
molecules are transmitted from a presynaptic membrane and captured
by a postsynaptic membrane. The space in between these membranes is
the synaptic cleft, and this is the area we will simulate.

This diffusion of molecules can be described via the diffusion
equation \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2
u}{\partial x^2}. \] In order to describe the physical situation
a numerical integration scheme can be implemented.

Solving this particular equation can provide challenges considering
the double spatial derivative on the right hand side. This can be
avoided via clever use of tridiagonal matrices.

The problem is solved via the explicit Forward Euler scheme, the
implicit Backward Euler scheme as well as the implicit Crank
Nicolson scheme. At later stages, an error analysis comparing the
three schemes is included to highlight potential error and to
illustrate areas of stability.

Each integration scheme produces an error and has an area of
stability. When comparing different numerical methods, these two
are key aspects.

A closed form solution to the problem is also found in order to
compare the numerical results and illustrate errors.
