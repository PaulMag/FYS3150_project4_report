In the following paragraphs, tests for different combinations of
step sizes $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ are done. The solution given
by the three integration schemes are then compared at two
strategically chosen time points $t_1$ and $t_2$ so that at $u(x,
t_1)$ the solution is curved but smooth and at $u(x, t_2)$ the
solution is approximately linear.

The test is done for $\Delta x = 1/10$ and $\Delta x = 1/100$.
$\Delta t$ is chosen to be the upper limit decided by the criterium
og stability \[ \alpha = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \leq
\frac{1}{2}. \] For the CrankNicolson and BackwardEuler scheme
stability will not be decided by this criterium, yet equal grounds
for the simulation will make comparing more meaningful. This gives
the following test cases.

\begin{tabular}[htbp]{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    Case & $\Delta x$ & $\Delta t$ \\
    \hline
    \hline
    Case 1 & 1/10 = 0.1 & $1/200 = 5 \cdot 10^{-3}$ \\
    \hline
    Case 2 & 1/100 = 0.01 & $1/20000 = 5 \cdot 10^{-5}$ \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
